## spindle - mechanistic model of muscle spindle sensory function
### How to use: the basics
1. Script to run model
    - See 'example.m' for working example
    - Script should set up time, command length, and gamma inputs as time-series
        - Command lengths should be in units of nm (1 L0 = 1300 nm)
        - Gamma activations should be in normalized units, from 0-1
    - Command length and gamma inputs should be expressed as a delta, rather than actual value
    - Pass conditioned inputs into 'sarcSimDriver.m' to return half-sarcomere objects and sim data
    - _TIP:_ Call 'sarcSimDriver.m' within a [parfor](https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/parfor.html) loop
    - Pass simulation data from driver into 'sarc2spindle.m' to return modeled muscle spindle firing rates

    
2. Simulation driver
    - *Would not recommend messing with this unless you want to be choosey about what data to store from sims*
    - 'sarcSimDriver.m' handles the sarcomere objects and data storage
    - Also handles different contextual simulation modes (slack mode vs. length control)

3. @halfSarcBag & @halfSarcChain
    - *Don't mess with this unless you want to fundamentally change the model*
    - Object definitions for bag and chain fibers, respectively
    - Based on [MyoSim](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933939/pdf/JGP_201311078.pdf), by Dr. Kenneth Campbell @ UK
